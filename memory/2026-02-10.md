### Tech Watch Blog - LLM Article Rewrite

**Context:** User complained that my LLM article was completely outdated:
- Referenced GPT-1 (ancient)
- Referenced "Cloud 3.5, Cloud 4" instead of Claude Opus 4.6
- Used my stale training knowledge instead of researching current data

**Lesson learned:** For tech articles, ALWAYS research current data. My training knowledge is outdated by 1-2 years. Must use web_search/web_fetch to get factual information.

**Research findings (February 2026):**
- **Claude Opus 4.6** released Feb 5, 2026 (5 days ago!) - leader in agentic coding
- **DeepSeek R1** = "DeepSeek Moment" from Jan 2025 that changed everything
- **Kimi K2** (Moonshot AI) called "second DeepSeek Moment" by community
- **GPT-OSS** - OpenAI's open source response to pressure
- **Llama 4** - Meta's continued open source push
- **Chinese models now dominate** Hugging Face downloads (+800% growth)
- **Mistral Large 3** - France remains competitive

**Action:** Completely rewrote article with factual data, proper sources cited (Hugging Face Blog, Anthropic Newsroom), and pushed to repo.

**Commit:** `ae957f7` — content: rewrite LLM article with factual data from February 2026

### Key Insight

The AI landscape has shifted dramatically:
- Open source is now viable for production (not just research)
- Chinese companies (DeepSeek, Moonshot, Alibaba/Qwen, Zhipu) are now leaders, not followers
- Claude Opus 4.6 currently dominates agentic coding
- DeepSeek R1's MIT license made advanced reasoning accessible to all

**Rule for future:** Never write tech content from memory alone. Always verify with live sources.
